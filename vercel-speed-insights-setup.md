# 🚀 Vercel Speed Insights Setup for Static HTML

## 📊 What is Speed Insights?

Vercel Speed Insights tracks your website's performance metrics including:
- **Real Experience Score** - How fast your site feels to users
- **First Contentful Paint** - How quickly content appears
- **Largest Contentful Paint** - Loading performance
- **Cumulative Layout Shift** - Visual stability

## ✅ Setup Complete

Speed Insights has been added to your `index.html` file with the correct script for static HTML sites.

## 🔧 For Other HTML Files

Add this script to the `<head>` section of other important pages:

```html
<!-- Vercel Speed Insights -->
<script>
  window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js"></script>
```

## 📁 Files to Update

Add the Speed Insights script to these key pages:
- ✅ `index.html` (already done)
- ⏳ `payment/6.html`
- ⏳ `payment/7.html`
